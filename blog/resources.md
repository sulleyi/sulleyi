# Resources

I've compiled some of my favorite resources on a variety of topics here.
They have helped me a ton when trying to learn new topics and I still refer to them
constantly. Hopefully you will find them helpful as well

## Machine Learning

- [Andrew Ng's Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
  >This is one of the most popular introductory machine learning courses and for good reason. Andrew
  is an incredibly knowledgeable instructor and his course is well worth your time.

- [Machine Learning Cheatsheet](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  >I Liked using this in tandem with Andrew's course, it has great to-the-point
  descriptions of many of the most important basic concepts in ML

- [MIT Introduction to MATLAB](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s997-introduction-to-matlab-programming-fall-2011/index.htm)
  > If you want to become great at using MATLAB, this is the course for you. It's a perfect supplement if you really want to understand
  how to implement your ML algorithms

- [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)
  >Another great introductory ML course, with a more top down approach.


## Misc

- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
  >A great reference site for all things comp sci. My primary go-to when I need to see implementation examples.
