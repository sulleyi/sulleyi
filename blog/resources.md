# Resources

I've compiled some of my favorite resources on a variety of topics here.
They have helped me a ton when trying to learn new topics and I still refer to them
constantly. Hopefully you will find them helpful as well.

## Machine Learning

- [Andrew Ng's Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
  >This is one of the most popular introductory machine learning courses and for good reason. Andrew
  is an incredibly knowledgeable instructor and his course is well worth your time.

- [Machine Learning Cheatsheet](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  >I Liked using this in tandem with Andrew's course, it has great to-the-point
  descriptions of many of the most important basic concepts in ML

- [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)
  >Another great introductory ML course, with a more top down approach.


## Computer Science

- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
  >A great reference site for all things comp sci. My primary go-to when I need to see implementation examples.

- [Martin Fowler's Site](https://martinfowler.com/)
  >If you want to learn the tried and true techniques for writing beautiful, bug-free code, this is the site for you.

- [Guide to Git](https://mg.readthedocs.io/index.html)

- [Guide to Computer Security](https://gist.github.com/nfarrar/b7fc7ded1858be854251)

- [Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science](https://introtcs.org/public/index.html)
  >As the title implies this is all theory. A very comprehensive guide to the math and principles
  that all of computational science is based on.

- [MIT Introduction to MATLAB](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s997-introduction-to-matlab-programming-fall-2011/index.html)
  > If you want to become great at using MATLAB, this is the course for you.
  It's a perfect supplement if you really want to understand how to implement your ML algorithms.

## Mathematics

- [MIT Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)
  >Incredibly informative course, Gilbert Strang is a wonderful instructor. A strong grasp of linear algebra is essential
  if you want to understand, analyze, and write your own ML algorithms.

- [Introduction to Higher Mathematics](https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/higher_math_online/)
  >Another comprehensive guide if you want to really understand the core tenants of Mathematics.
  The foundation of computing is built on computational mathematics and logic.
