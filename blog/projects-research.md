## My Current Research


I am currently gather information on tinyML, federated machine learning, generative adversarial networks, and computational security specifically regarding ML and AI algorithms. The ethical use of (ML & AI) software relies on the continuous development of secure systems that value robustness and user privacy. Federated Learning shows great promise as a starting point in solving these issues.



## My Current Projects

- Completing  the [deeplearning.ai Neural Networks and Deep Learning Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)
- A website for Entrepreneurs of the Nott (E.O.N), an entrepreneurship club at Union College.
- a text summarizer utilizing word2vec, OpenAI's GPT-2 algorithm, and proprietary deep learning algorithms with Union College ACM-W.
