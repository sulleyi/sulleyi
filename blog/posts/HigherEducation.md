There is **a lot** of literature concerning the current state of higher education, usually concerning the outrageous price.

Yesterday, in the middle of my daily Youtube binge I stubbled upon a talk by Malcom Gladwell given at Google Zeitgeist. He correlated SAT scores of incoming students pursuing stem degrees at 4 year colleges with their likelihood of graduating with a STEM degree. He compared students at Hartwick College to students at Harvard University, and found that for both institutions the students in the top quarter of class rankings where very likely to graduate with a stem degree while those in the bottom quarter where very unlikely to graduate with a STEM degree and much more likely to drop out of the program. This is despite the fact that the bottom quarter of students at Harvard University had the same SAT scores as the top quarter of students at Hartwick. In Summary, his argument was that completing a degree is not a measure of Intelligence but a measure of your class ranking. Malcolm Gladwell thinks you should go to Hardwick instead of Harvard to ensure you are in the top of your class and therefore more likely to graduate with the STEM degree you initially intended on pursuing. I disagree.

Now, I realize Malcolm Gladwell intended for this opinion of his to be controversal. From what I know about him, he likes to make unconventional arguements, play devils advocate, and highlight new ways of thinking that go against the unconventional wisdom. I believing questioning the world in this way is extremely benefitial for everyone. Question Everything. This is not an article to bash Malcolm Gladwell, I'm actually a fan of his work, and find him to be a skilled and entertaining thinker and storyteller. Despite disagreeing with the logical foundations of his arguement I do think he has a compelling conclusion. More broadly I am a fan of much of his work (particularly his podcast,  Revionist History) and really enjoy how the way he presents his topics inspires me to contemplate them further on my own.

Okay, now onto the interesting stuff.

- I agree with the conclusion, "Don't go to Harvard"

Far too many students who idolize the Ivy League and extremely competitive institutions. Don't get me wrong, these institutions have enormous value for society as a whole, but I believe the value they provide to indivuals is incredibly overblown and only serves a very particular type of student.


My main problem with Both Harvard and Malcolm Gladwell's arguement is ego. Students apply to institutions on the standard of name recognition alone, often with very little knowledge of what attending a school like this actually means for them.

Harvard has an ego. On the other hand, going to an institution where you will be the top of the class is also likely to leave you with an ego.

In Highschool I attended a prestigous school that was very wellknown in my local community. However, in that institution I was seemingly in the lower 50% of the class ranking (gladly my school did not track or publish these statistics so I'm simply going by personal intuition). I felt uncomfortable by the praise I recieve from attending such a school as  I felt I really hadn't worked that hard to earn it, and was not nearly as competent and successful as some of my peers.
Being in the 




Now, I attend a selective small liberal arts college and am in the top 25% of my class rank. I definitely feel this has had an unheathy impact on my ego.


Moshe Vardi also had some great things to say on this topic in this podcast. We train professors to be very career oriented (and self obsessed) and therefore they fail in their primary role as a public servant.
