## This Blog

I made this blog using the [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) blog boilerplate which is incredibly simple and straight forward.
vuepress was developed by the creator of vue.js to power the vue.js documentation as well as his personal blog.
This blog is hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), making building and deploying updates incredibly easy. Once I push an update to the master branch of my GitHub
it is automatically built and deployed by Netlify.
