I'll be compiling some of my favorite machine learning resources [here](../resources.html#machine-learning).
I will try to keep that list as up-to-date as possible. I will be further documenting my progress and insights here.


*Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Deep Learning* , yada yada yada... I'm sure you've heard the buzzwords by now.
I hope that with this guide I can help demystify some of the hype and explain the fundamental ideas and math these concepts stem from

Stay tuned, coming in the near future.
