## Objectives

The Evolutionary Robotics Lab at Union College is trying to teach complex robots how to learn. 

## The Challenges of Controlling Soft Robots 

Soft Robotics is a particularly challenging area of interes. 
__Soft Robot__ = A robot with many degrees of freedom.

The properties of Soft Robots make them especially challenging to model and control. 


### Tesegrities
Tensegrities are defined by their topology, which is made up of an interconnected network of rigid struts and soft materials to apply
tension between struts (ie. springs, cable, rope). 


# Evolutionary Algorithms

## Quality Diversity

###Map Elites


### Development Tools

[DEAP]() 
Framework for designing and runninng experiments with  Evolutionary Algorithms.

[qdpy]()
Python implementation of commmon quality diversity algorithms, including Map Elites and CMA.
