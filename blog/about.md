# About Me
My name is Ian Sulley and I am currently an undergraduate student at [Union College](https://union.edu).
I am majoring in computer engineering with minors in mathematics and data analytics. I spend most
of my time learning interesting (albeit occasionally useless) things on the internet.

## My tools

Nvim is my primary text editor, used in tandem with tmux. With these tools, I do most of my development on my desktop running OpenSUSE Leap
15.1. When I am not physically in front of my desktop I am using PuTTY on my laptop to SSH into it.
I also occasionally use Jetbrains' IDEs for Python and Java.
