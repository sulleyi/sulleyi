# About Me
My name is Ian Sulley and I am currently an undergraduate student and Seward fellow at [Union College](https://union.edu).
I am double majoring in computer engineering and mathematics with a research minor in embedded machine learning. I spend most
of my time learning interesting (albeit occasionally useless) things on the internet.

## My tools

VSCode is my primary editor, along with an onslaught of plugins. Sometimes I also use Nvim in tandem with tmux when working with embedded systems.
