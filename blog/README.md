I began this site to share my personal experiences to inform and inspire others.
I highly value community and collaboration and it is my hope that this site will be a good way to
share my process and learn from others. If you have any criticisms or would like to discuss any content
on this blog, please feel free to reach out.  It is my personal belief that community and collaboration are
key to both "the good life" and good code. I hope that this blog will help spawn collaboration for myself and my readers.

## Welcome!

I was inspired to start this site by my good friend [Miles Conn](http://milesconn.io).
Go check out his site for more musings on technology. Thanks for the help in getting
this site set up.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy this site. Go learn something **new**!

### Now Entering a Construction Zone. *Hardhats Required*

I'm just getting started so there isn't much to see here yet. Come back later for some cool content!

If you care to see what I'm currently working on, check out my [Github](https://github.com/sulleyi).
