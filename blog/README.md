# Ian Sulley's Blog

> A blog to chronicle my journey in education, research, and software development

## Welcome!

I was inspired to start this site by my good friend [Miles Conn](milesconn.io).
Go check out his site for more musings on technology. Thanks for the help in getting
this site set up.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy this site. Go learn something **new**!

There isn't much to see here yet, I'm just getting started. Come back later for some cool content!
