# The Co[de]-Lab
> A blog to chronicle experiences in education, research, and software development.

## Welcome!

I began this site to document and share my personal experiences so that they may inform and inspire others. It is my hope that this site will be a good way to share my process and garner feedback.
I want to be transparent in my development of projects and ideas, so that others will have the information necessary to comment and critique my work, or use them as a starting point for their own work. If you have any criticisms or would like to discuss any content that has been published on this site, please feel free to reach out. the whole point of this site relies on **your** input, feedback, and participation.  It is my personal belief that community and collaboration are key to achieving good code, and more importantly "The Good Life" (yes there are things more important than good code!). I hope this site helps spawn collaboration for myself and my readers.

I was inspired to start this site by my good friend [Miles Conn](http://milesconn.io).
Go check out his site for more musings on technology. Thanks for the help in getting
this site set up.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy this site. Go learn something **new**!

### Now Entering a Construction Zone. *Hardhats Required*

I'm just getting started so there isn't much to see here yet. Come back later for some cool content!
